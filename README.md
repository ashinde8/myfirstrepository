Finding Zero of Function.

Here I define a function to find the zero point of f(x). In this function, there is a lambda function f(x), with initial value of x0, constant Î´, and .
The stop condition of this function is |wn+1 âˆ’ wn| < . The function is tested at x0 = âˆ’5 and x0 = 0

Here I find a x*, let f(x*) = 0, we say x* is the zero point of this function.
I have used the Euler method to find the zero point of function.

The forward Euler algorithm is described
as
wn+1 = wn âˆ’ Î´ Â· f(wn)

With increase in n, we observe that |wn+1âˆ’wn| < , here we define  = 0.001. Thus, we say wn is converged, and x* = wn or f(x*) = 0

function f
f(x) = 2x + 4 (2)

function g:
g(x) = x Â· sin(x) âˆ’ 1
